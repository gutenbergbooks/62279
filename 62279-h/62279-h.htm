<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">After an extended trip of two months,
which led me throughout the North
American continent, it was a rare treat
to settle down again to routine duties on the
Whiz Bang farm. The main street of our own
little “Gopher Prairie” looked mighty good to
a tired and worn out farmer. ’Twas indeed a
pleasure to view the Howard lumber yard, with
its red fence and shed, and to grasp the sturdy
hand of our village postmaster and storekeeper,
Bud Nasett. J. J. McCormick, who is depot
agent and telegraph operator, not to mention
baggage smasher for genial drummers, greeted
me at the station.</p>

<p>“How are you, Bill, you old son-of-a-gun?”
or words to this effect, was the whole-hearted
way that Mac welcomed back a wayward and
prodigal pilgrim.</p>

<p>Arm in arm we walked along Main Street
to Gus Urban’s meat market to inquire as to
the price of livestock. Mr. Urban, in his usual
jovial embonpoint manner, informed us that
cows brought five cents a pound, but that bull
was priceless. I disagreed with Gus, insisting
that my recent journeys in quest of the pedigreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
animal had left me “flat broke.”</p>

<p>Directly across the street, neatly encased in
imitation granite blocks of concrete, is our only
bank, the Security State of Robbinsdale—and it
hasn’t gone “bump” for nigh onto four years.
In the reorganization which followed the last
crash, Joe Roche was selected as cashier and
Joe has since successfully piloted this financial
bulwark of our happy little village. Joe also
manages the Robbinsdale baseball nine. After
making a small “touch” at the bank it was home
and the farm.</p>

<p>My welcome back was so pleasant that the
words of that rural gem—“The Little Old Home
Town”—went Whiz-Zing through my jaded
mind.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Bobby Nelson, our neighbor’s boy, is
the worst kid in the world for betting,
and the unusual feature of it is he
usually wins. Bobby’s father took the matter
up with the school marm to see if she couldn’t
break him of the gambling habit, promising
her a reward if successful.</p>

<p>The other morning when Bobby came to
school he wanted to bet teacher she had a wart
on her right knee and the school marm, knowing
better, and thinking she had an opportunity
to win a bet from Bobby and by so doing, discourage
his betting habit, accepted Bobby’s
challenge. After school that evening teacher
proved Bobby was wrong and won the two
dollar bet.</p>

<p>She then called on old man Nelson.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nelson, I have broken Bobby of the
betting habit. It was a little embarrassing,
but this is how it was—Bobby bet me two dollars
I had a wart on my right knee and in
order to make him lose and cure him of the
betting habit I accepted his challenge.”</p>

<p>“Lady! Lady! Why did you do it? Bobby
bet me this morning ten dollars that he would
see your knee before the day was out.”</p>

and the people who attended were very
ill mannered. Why, I never saw such
impolite people. We were all seated around
the dinner table and when they brought the
turkey in to serve, everybody made a grab for
it, but the two legs I got tasted very good.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Out in Idaho it is reported that the natives
are making booze in this manner—women
chew corn and then “gob” it into a
hollowed-out section of a tree trunk. Water is
added and the mess allowed to ferment, after
which it is imbibed to intoxication. Some drink,
we would pause to remark!</p>

<p class="dropcap">A friend of mine told me the other night
he slept in a wagon standing in an alley,
and when he woke up in the morning he
had nothing but a dime in his pocket. He was
thirsty and he also needed a shave, so he
decided to toss the coin to see whether he would
get a shave or a drink. He tossed up the dime,
and when it came down he missed it and it
rolled near a sewer grating, coming to a
standstill just half over the edge of the grating.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he exclaimed, “that was a close shave.
I guess I’ll get a drink.”</p>

I traded a Whiz Bang to a kid at the

<p class="dropcap">Now, Fellow Soaks, we’ll touch a few high
spots in this grand and glorious continent
as we ramble about with wry faces in
pursuit of the elusive Scotch and Bubbon. San
Diego and its fashionable suburb, Coronado,
were tough spots for a thirsty Minnesota
farmer. Nothing but a concoction commonly
called “sympathy” gin to be had by a meek and
lowly stranger. But, glory be to Mexico, Tiajuana
with its old time western bar-rooms and
music halls, is but an hour away.</p>

<p>We spent one grand and glorious afternoon
and evening in this unique village. It reminded
me of slumming expeditions of a quarter century
ago. Visions of Omaha’s famous Arcade
at Capitol Avenue and Ninth Street, and of
Duluth’s “Minnesota Point” in its palmy days,
not to mention the cribs of Dupont Street in
Frisco, went flitting through my frappe’d brain.</p>

<p>In one solace of joy we sat at a table for
Haig and Haig “service,” said service being delivered
by jaded janes who divided their time
between waiting on customers and jazz dancing
to the tinny tunes of a tin pan orchestra.
It was a wild place and a wild night. Later we
dined at the Sunset Inn. The inn was flanked
by rooms filled with scores of roulette wheels
and faro tables. My sporting blood surged
hither and thither but to no avail, for the
Mexican government had placed a temporary
ban on this style of gambling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Alcatraz Island, that silent citadel that
illumines the skyline of Frisco’s bay like a
bleak battleship, is the temporary home of
about five hundred United States soldiers who
have become ensnarled in the tough and tedious
red tape of Uncle Sam’s court martial system.
Prisons and morgues are two places I abhor,
but it fell my lot to visit both in one night in
San Francisco.</p>

<p>It happened like this: While entertaining
some new found Frisco friends in my room in
the St. Francis Hotel, I was pleasantly surprised
by the head director of the Jewish Welfare
Board, Shea Swartz by name, who
requested on behalf of the Board, that my pedigreed
bunk be spread on the rocky soil of
Alcatraz. The five hundred boys gathered in
the barrack auditorium and gave the Whiz
Bang a grand and glorious welcome. It was
one of the bright lights of a very enjoyable
tour of the coast.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, accompanied by George
Duffy and G. W. DeLano of the district attorney’s
office, we inspected the famous San
Francisco morgue. It was a gruesome visit,
I’ll admit, but some of the curse was removed
by the marvelous furniture and apparatus used
in the handling of the unfortunate.</p>

<p>From the morgue we glimpsed a view of the
city jail, through the kind offices of Walter C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Schiller, who is bond and warrant clerk in the
Hall of Justice.</p>

<p>It was next to Chinatown where we were
met by the sergeant in charge of the Chinatown
vice squad. Two of his operatives conducted
our party through a score or more of
Chink gambling and hop joints that had
recently been raided. We sincerely thank the
squad, but regret not having seen one or two
places that had not been raided.</p>

<p>It is the hour of dusk that Chinatown pads
to and fro noiselessly. In the little tangle of
crooked streets, blue lozenges of lights, sitting
gods and queer smells that babble of Oriental
talk is incessant at this hour. Women parade
in gaudy headdress and beads of jade. The
men wear their gaudiest silken robes. There
are dried-up men whose faces are old with the
age of eastern lore, young women who walk
with mincing steps and Oriental grace, cherry-cheeked
babies tottering uncertainly.</p>

<p>We passed up Honolulu until later in the
year and made a transcontinental jump to New
York to try and “Get Gertie’s Garter.” Don’t
believe I’ll ever be contented “down on the
farm” after all the wonderful people and wonderful
sights of the past two months. But here
goes for Lil’ Ol’ New Yawk, as seen through
the eyes of a farmer.</p>

<h2><i>Blistering Broadway</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the old days we used to hear startling
tales of the decadence of the Paris
theatre. It is no longer necessary to cross
the pond to have one’s aesthetic (?) senses
stirred. The New York stage will do it for you
this season. Right behind the Broadway footlights
you can see everything done in the name
of Art from witnessing a young lady actually
climb in a bed already occupied by a male to
observing a squad of girls play strip poker
until—</p>

<p>But let us go back to the beginning. They
say that it is a dull season in New York and
that no one is spending money—at least for
theatre tickets. Hence the frantic effort to
whet the jaded appetites of the elusive theatre-goers.</p>

<p>Let us list some of the more sprightly attractions.
Bear in mind that some of them
have excellent qualities. There is, for instance,
Somerset Maugham’s “The Circle,” telling of
an old couple who have broken all the conventions
and of a younger couple about to follow
in their footsteps. It is told with lively cleverness.
No, indeed, the young people do not find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a moral in the experiences of their elders. At
the end they dash away to investigate the
illicit love-in-a-cottage stuff themselves and
Mr. Maugham points out that in life it doesn’t
matter “what you do as much as what you are.”
And also that “you can do anything in this
world if you’re prepared to take the consequences
and consequences depend on character.”
All of which is excellent mental food for the
1921 flapper.</p>

<p>Then there is Cosmo Hamilton’s “The Silver
Fox,” a little epic of a philandering wife with
a penchant for young men and abbreviated
socks. Clever, too, but decadent.</p>

<p>Also we might note “Ambush,” the opus of
a young woman who likes pretty things and
who is aided and abetted by her mother. Papa
is a poor commuter who wakes up when
daughter introduces a flip and married gentleman
friend. When he protests, daughter slaps
his face and snaps “Damn you!” Still, there
is some excuse for “Ambush.” At least it is
well written.</p>

<p>Here we turn to the plain every day efforts
to be insolently sensational at any price.</p>

<p>“Getting Gertie’s Garter” (note the chaste
title), was one of the earliest of the sexly
stimulants. But garters have lost their vogue
and, anyway, the short skirts have ruined their
novelty. So the piece did not seriously upset
New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there’s “Lilies of the Field,” for instance,
a demi-mondaine treatise anent certain
lilies who “toil not neither do they spin,” or
however it was that the Good Book let down
the gold diggers of the old days. This is especially
recommended for the eighteen-year-old
flapper.</p>

<p>With which we arrive at the real blush
producers of the year. Consider “Bluebeard’s
Eighth Wife.” Here a young woman, newly
married, invites her old sweetheart to her
boudoir at midnight, gets him squiffy and persuades
him to undress and climb into bed.
And undress he does, right down to his B. V.
D.’s in front of the footlights, the appreciative
heroine and the audience. Said heroine then
clambers in—and friend husband appears. Yes,
it’s all to teach hubby a lesson (one must make
some concession to the police) and the B. V. D.
person gets the air.</p>

<p>Broadway had been busily getting out its
shekels to see Bluebeard and the B. V. D. youth
when along came Avery Hopwood’s “The Demi-Virgin.”
Now, Mr. Hopwood’s demi-virgin is
not the demi-vierge of the French, from whom
the noun comes. Since this is a family paper,
we will explain demi-vierge as a young and
ambitious lady who is broadminded up to a
certain point. Mr. Hopwood’s heroine, however,
is a movie queen who deserts her husband,
another movie idol, on their wedding night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Although the husband finally succeeds in
capturing his demi-wife in her boudoir and
thereupon starts out to—well—anyway the real
incident of the piece is the aforementioned
strip poker party, where a half dozen film
fillies discard garment after garment in a game
designed to be thrilling. It isn’t a mere strip
poker party but a “strip cupid” affair, the first
to arrive at the cupid state to be the winner—or
loser. The game progresses until it is a
mere matter of a card’s turn who is to be cupid
when, of course, the thing is ended.</p>

<p>This, then, is the state of the New York
stage at this moment. Meanwhile, film fans
see life on the screen through the eyes of little
Rollo while, just around the corner, six young
women are in the act of taking off their pink
envelope thing-ums while an appreciative audience
applauds. Not, of course, that we’re for
censorship anywhere. But the New York stage
producer seems to be able to get away with
anything.</p>

<p>It is making it awfully hard for the musical
comedy producer. Years ago he reached a certain
limit in bare revelations and now the
drama comes along and wins away the tired
business man. Of course, the musical comedy
maker isn’t giving up without a fight. Now
and then he has an inspiration, as when, in the
new Greenwich Village Follies, he reveals a
lady to personify Art dressed exclusively in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
three golden leaves, each placed with fine discernment
and discretion.</p>

<p>The next step on the New York stage will
probably come when the musical comedy producer
raises—or lowers—his limit. Despite our
youth, we can recall—vividly—when he made
the step from tights and stockings to bare legs,
the only thing left is for him to ape the
Parisian producer and have costumes stop their
upward trend at the waist. We shall see, we
shall see!</p>

<p>Speaking about high-brow poetry, we have

<h3>Charlie’s Delicate Habits</h3>

<p>A nice young man called on a nice young
lady and spent the evening recently. When he
arrived there was not a cloud in the sky, so he
carried no umbrella and wore no goloshes nor
mackintosh. At 10:00 o’clock when he arose to
go, it was raining pitchforks and grindstones.</p>

<p>“My, my, my!” said the nice young lady, “if
you go out in this storm you will catch your
death of cold.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I might,” was the trembling
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what—stay all night; you
can have Tom’s room, as he is visiting uncle
and aunt up in the country. Yes, occupy Tom’s
room. Excuse me a minute, and I’ll just run
up and see if it’s in order.”</p>

<p>The young lady fled gracefully upstairs to
see if any tidying was necessary. In five minutes
she came down to announce that the room
was in readiness, but no Charles was in sight.
In a very few minutes, however, he appeared,
dripping wet and out of breath from running
and with a bundle in a newspaper under his
arm.</p>

<p>The nice young lady greeted him with:
“Why, Charles, where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Been home after my night shirt,” was his
reply, as he hung his hat up to drip.</p>

getting a star acceptable alike to the garment
workers, buttonhole makers, laundry operators
and health authorities.</p>

in Wanta Daddy’s latest paramour picture,

Dome came all the way from New York to

<p class="dropcap">Jazz life seems to agree with Americans.
We not only live faster than our great-
grandparents, but, on the average, we also
live eight years longer. So says the Census
Bureau.</p>

<p>Some day the centenarian will be the rule,
not the exception. That will come as a result
of health education, not from eating monkey
glands.</p>

<p>A popular song had this refrain: “He may
be old, but he’s got young ideas.” That appealed
to popular fancy because it caught the subconscious
mind, which probably knew what the
census now reports:</p>

<p>That marriages of persons beyond fifty
years of age are steadily increasing in numbers,
already being frequent. Out of 100 American
men and women, 80 are married before
they reach 45, while 10 take the leap afterward
and 10 remain single.</p>

<p>Divorces among those who have passed 45
are also becoming more common. This, however,
is not making us a cynical people, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
census finds that the majority of divorced
people try marriage at least a second time,
many making three or four ventures.</p>

<p>Figures—which never lie, though liars often
figure—show that the span of life is lengthening
during the Jazz Age.</p>

<p>The strain at times gets on our nerves. Frequently
one of the contestants howls and goes
to pieces. But, on the average, the real effects
of the Jazz Age will not show up until our
descendants of one hundred years or more
hence.</p>

<h3>They Named the Soap After Him</h3>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p><i>In Dr. W. A. Evans’ column in the Minneapolis Journal,
“A. G. M.” writes, under the heading of the Artistic Sex</i>:</p>

<p>“I have a son, seventeen years old, who is and has
been for ten years, obsessed with a strange desire. He
wants and feels that he ought to be a girl. Ever since
he was seven years old, and probably before, although I
had never noticed it, he has thought of himself as a girl,
acted like one, desired to be regarded as a girl, and has,
whenever he could worn girls’ clothing.</p>

<p>“His mother and I had a terrific struggle to allow his
hair to be cut like a boys’, when he was six or seven
years old. He withstood us until he was nearly ten,
when, for the sake of peace, he consented to have it
bobbed. Up to that time he had worn it in a great mass
of curls, away down over his shoulders, regardless of the
ridicule of his playmates. He wore his hair bobbed until
two years ago, when he finally had it cut after a fashion
similar to other boys. This is just one incident, but it
may serve to show you something of his frame of mind.</p>

<p>“He attended a gymnasium class until he was fourteen,
and he invariably wore bloomers and a bow of ribbon in
his hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“In fact, he is far more at home in girls’ clothing
than he is in boys’, for he has always insisted on wearing
dresses and gowns when in the house. His bedroom
is a real girl’s boudoir, with dressing table, powder puff,
etc. He has as few boys’ clothes as he can get along with
for going out. Playing with dolls was his favorite amusement
until he was about thirteen. He is about five feet
eleven and one-half inches tall, good looking and possessed
of a remarkably good mind. He never has given any
signs of mental deficiency, unless you term what I have
above described as mental deficiency, or rather insanity.
I would be grateful if you would tell me your opinion.”</p>

<p><i>(Dr. Evans’ answer): This is a case of third or intermediate
sexism. You will find a fair amount of literature
on the subject. Such subjects are not in any sense feeble-minded.
In fact, many of them are exceptionally bright.
As a rule the stage, music or painting offers the best fields
for men and women of this group.</i></p></div>

<p>Wonder what our friends of the theatre
think of Dr. Evans’ advice? Probably they
would feel the same way as the Army officials
felt towards certain chiefs of police who
paroled the bums and the crooks on condition
they join the Army.</p>

<h2><i>The Flesh Pots of Egypt</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Allah be praised! Here I am in Alexandria,
the city founded by Alexander
the Great. Yet Alex. could never conquer
this part of the world today—the smells
would put him to rout. This polyglot port is
in “Lower” Egypt, and its dives are among the
lowest found anywhere. The Rue des Soeurs
is a street where crooked people go straight to
perdition. Gambling hells are overflowing.
Sailors and soldiers from the four corners of
the globe crowd the cafes, where guitars twang,
pianos jangle, drunks bawl, booze flows, choruses
cheer and women leer. Fleshy Fatimas,
overpainted and underclothed prowl about the
street seeking whom they may devour. From
lighted windows come droning nasal songs—</p>

<p>All aboard for Cairo, city of the Caliphs,
and I felt like taking a board and spanking
the exposed anatomy of the Arab youths who
posed along the railroad tracks to shock and
mock the passengers.</p>

<p>Leaving the black sheep tourists at “Shepherds”
Hotel, I visited the mosques which are
as numerous in Cairo as mosquitoes in New
Jersey. There may be a thousand; I visited
five hundred, more or less. Sometimes I took
off my slippers at the outer door, and at others
I wore a kind of moccasin over my tourist
shoes and shuffled and slid over the old floors,
wondering how in the name of everything
sacred I could profane anything with a good
“sole” like mine. In my fling about the city I
visited the Whirling Dervishes who whirled
and dervished for me to my heart’s content
with a poetry of motion a Sitka Indian could
never attain. My head grows dizzy and my
stomach faint when I think of them and their
musical accompaniment of tambourines and
flutes which were a cross between an ungreased
saw and the breathing of an overdriven horse.
I left before these human tops stopped spinning,
and I carried away the memory of their
tomato-can hats, bell-shaped robes, half-closed
eyes, drooping heads and extended arms. I
still see the uplifted right palm catching a
blessing from Allah, the left hand turned down
to bestow it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Cairo’s amusements are varied: you may
attend the opera house and listen to Italian
music or see a French farce; take a turn at the
hippodrome and have a circus; or stop at an
open air play on the Esbekeeyah; or, if religiously
inclined, take in the convent with its
dancing dervishes and barbarous music; watch
snake-charmers, glass-eaters, sword-swallowers,
long-haired fakirs, chibook-smokers and munchers
of scorpions; sip cafe noir (that looks and
tastes like sweetened Nile mud) in a little shop
where the waiters and loungers are as thick as
the drink; or see Arabs gamble with dice and
cards, much as they do in America; go to a kind
of vaudeville, where a stringed band of lady-performers
try to beguile travelers, with American
airs and Persian dances, into buying drinks
for them at the rate of one or two dollars a
bottle, and poor stuff at that; or meander
through the Fish Market at midnight where
streets are filled with citizens and sight-seers,
sidewalks with roystering soldiers, bazaars
with shrewd traders, dens with drunken
natives, and miles of houses with women outcasts
from all quarters of the globe, leering,
lurking and lustful, caged like wild beasts behind
iron-barred gratings which are necessary
to keep them from murderous assault on the
morals, money and lives of the passersby. I
was held up in an alleyway by a beautiful
Ghawazee girl who said, with outstretched
hand, “Me backsheesh to give God.” She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
need a bank-roll to get full pardon for her multitudinous
mistakes. The resorts where naked
women invite you to see the “Danse du Ventre,”
a Terpsichorean exercise not noted for its modesty,
and the mahsheshehs, or hang-outs where
hasheesh smokers stimulate themselves into
idiotic talk and laughter and stupefy their
brains into a narcotic nepenthe of poverty, hunger
and dirt, may seem quite unethical to the
Occidental tenderfoot, but they are Christian
places of entertainment compared with those
infamous joints in the Fish Market where men,
dressed up like women, carry on. These bordels
had their prototype of old in the Egyptian temples
of Isis.</p>

<p>I entered a Cafe Chantant where, before an
entranced audience, two daughters of the
desert, with incandescent kohl-stained eyes and
sin-stained souls, were going through the
sinuous undulations of the “hooche-cooche.”
They moved their necks to and fro like cobras
before a snake-charmer, and the motion of hip,
breast and abdomen thrilled the spectators.
These Egyptian dancers show a laxity of muscles
and morals, and dance in a way that makes
it unnecessary to attend a gymnasium. The
dishes served were delicate, but the songs were
indelicate, to say the least. There was a very
pathetic one which I translate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O damsel! thy silk shirt is worn out, and thine arms have become visible,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And I fear for thee, on account of the blackness of thine eyes.</div>
<div class="verse">I desire to intoxicate myself, and kiss thy cheeks,</div>
<div class="verse">And do deeds that ’Antar did not.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Oriental orchestra was made up of a
darabooka drum, made of a wooden cylinder
over which is stretched a parchment; the tar,
a sort of tambourine; the kemengeh, a viol of
two strings with a cocoanut sounding-body; the
kanoon, a stringed instrument held on the
knees and played with the fingers; the ’ood, a
guitar with seven double strings; and the nay,
a reed flute blown at the end. The music produced
is most unspeakably unspiritual and
nasally noisome. It outranks the obligato
serenade of a love-sick tom-cat. The melody is
old as the Libyan hills. Is this what Mark
Antony heard when he fell for Cleopatra? If
so, what a fall there was, my countrymen!</p>

<p>Here I bade adieu to the country which has
all that was, is and ever will be. Good-bye,
Egypt! Land of faro-banks and Pharaoh mummies—of
backsheesh, bad smells, sphinx and
blase globe-trotters! Paradise of palm trees,
pyramids and postcard-venders! Desert domain
of donkeys, dirt and dervishes—of tombs,
temples, turbaned thieves and veiled vampires!
Home of camel, crocodile, can-can and Cleopatra!
Farewell, till we meet again!</p>

on pretty intimate terms, at the time, and there
was quite a bit of scandal going around concerning
them.</p>

<p>After a little Columbus said, “Say, Bella, I
believe if I had a couple of schooners I could
sail over and discover America.” She answered,
“All right, Colum.”</p>

<p>Soon after, Columbus sailed away and sailed
for years and years. One day one of his men
hurried below and in an excited voice said,
“Columbus, I see land.”</p>

<p>On landing, they found the Indians all lined
up and down the shore waiting for them.
Columbus stepped ahead and said, “Hello, is
this the United States?” “Yes,” said the chief,
“we got your cablegram and have been waiting
here to be discovered.” Whereupon Columbus
erected a post and put up a brass tablet
giving date of discovery, etc.</p>

<p>After that, he moved to Ohio, and anyone
passing can see Columbus in Ohio.</p>

<h3>Hard Boiled Muggsy</h3>

<p>A mission worker on the lower East Side,
New York, was telling the story of Adam and
Eve to a group of tough kids. When he was
through, one boy asked Hard-boiled Muggsy
what it was all about.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell yer,” said Muggsy, “there was a
guy and a ‘broad’ in a garden. They ‘snitched’
an apple; a snake ‘peached’ on ’em, and God
said tuhel with ’em.”</p>

<h3>Shall We Forgive Her?</h3>

<p>A dainty little blonde miss of twenty-two
stepped into a phone booth. She drew forth

nickel. She placed the nickel in the slot with
the softest, white and well kept hands that
anyone has seen. She took up the receiver and
with a soft sweet voice of a great singer spoke
the number to the operator. She waited and
waited and waited and waited, first on one foot
and then on the other. She had waited an
awful long time. All of a sudden she banged
the receiver down and hissed between her
lovely, pearly teeth, a well sounded “Damn it.”</p>

<h3>That Waltz</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE GEORGIA CRACKER</p>

<p>As the music began, the lights grew soft
and dim. I watched the couples as they passed
like phantoms in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then I saw her, dancing with some wretched
novice who could scarcely keep on his feet. How
lovely and how wretched she looked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kathleen!” I exclaimed, half aloud, and
advanced.</p>

<p>“May I break?” I asked, and took her into
my arms.</p>

<p>Her dancing—how can I describe it? She
moved like some sprite—sure-footed languorous,
as light as a summer cloud.</p>

<p>Drawing her to me, I suited my steps to the
slow, yearning melody of the waltz. As we
glided in the semi-darkness, oblivious of the
passing couples she pressed her glowing cheek
to mine and breathed quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh”—</p>

<p>“Sweetheart, why cannot I hold you like this
forever? I feel that you are a part of my very
soul!”</p>

<p>“Hold me—oh, hold me tight!”</p>

<p>“I have lived always for this moment.
Dearest, you are the only girl in the whole
world—you <i>are</i> the whole world”—</p>

<p>And there, our eyes closed in ecstasy, I
kissed her.</p>

<p>“I love you! The universe was made for
the rapture of this moment. The stars have
shone in vain for ages that they might light
your eyes now! All time has been but a prelude
to this second! Say you love me! Just say it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimmy, you know I do!”</p>

<p>“Why, Kathleen, this isn’t Jimmy!” I cried.</p>

<p>“And this isn’t Kathleen,” replied the
stranger.</p>

<p>Captain Billy’s Whiz Bang is the first magazine
to have a “city” named after it.</p>

<p>The thriving little oil town of Oklahoma has
been christened Whiz Bang City. The picture
shown on this page is by courtesy of Vince Dillon,
photographer of Fairfax, Okla. Upon close examination,
“kind readers” note that all of the
buildings are new and that a truck standing in
front of the garage bears the sign Nitroglycerine.
However, there is no connection between nitroglycerine
and the Whiz Bang. It is true that we
have an explosion, but ours is harmless, and used
to blow out the spleen of the American human
instead of Mother Earth.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, folk, here’s wishing many
happy days to Whiz Bang City and its live
citizens.</p>
